# Corner-Detection-Algorithms
Analyze the interaction between various scoring functions and automatic threshold detection. In more specific terms, scoring functions (corner detections) are to be applied to the image, then the resulting gradient magnitudes are to be subjected to automatic threshold detection.

# Steps
In more specific terms, scoring functions (corner detections) are to be applied to the image, then the resulting gradient magnitudes are to be subjected to automatic threshold detection. As per that, the following components are to be implemented:
- Corner detection:
  - Harris.
  - SUSAN.
- Automatic threshold detection:
  - Calculate convex hull.
